self brief- Did most of my work on the media tabs and for the most part it works on the 1920, tablet size, and 375 pixels which was required. but if you go before or after that it will mess up. i should have used the d-none instead because they created a wider range and should have used less position absolutes. towards the end more thing i refined on but its still not the best.

peer review - The layout is nice and organized. Minor fixes ex:  Font text & size, image size, image alignment. Responsive in certain parts of the site but some could use some work. Reducing the amount of images/text visible when on mobile or tablet was a nice touch. If there was no mockup to copy, it would function as a nice website.
- why homeboy got two nav bars?
