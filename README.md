peer reviewer - Tommy Ngo
peer review - The layout is nice and organized. Minor fixes ex:  Font text & size, image size, image alignment. Responsive in certain parts of the site but some could use some work. Reducing the amount of images/text visible when on mobile or tablet was a nice touch. If there was no mockup to copy, it would function as a nice website.
- why homeboy got two nav bars?
